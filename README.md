## NOTHING BUT SOME NOTES YET

The Bicycle Service API

- [Overview](#Overview)

Overview
=======================================================
Bicycle online workshop is a service 
>Good architecture allows the software to be changed during its lifetime with as little, constant effort as possible (and correspondingly predictable costs for the client)." 
According to Robert C. Martinâ€™s book â€œClean Architecture


Domain entities implements critical business rules and are not the same with jpa entities. 
Obviously domain entities are mutable, we can easily change entity state, client name etc.
From the other hand, the greater part of domain entity must consist of immutable value objects instead of primitives.
They must have a unique identifier, that does not match tot the jpa entity ID value. 
Basically domain entity id should be a value object to keep it immutable. 


## ENTITY
### ID as value object

According to the Eric Evans`s book "Domain-Driven Design. Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software":

* Many objects are not fundamentally defined by their attributes, but rather by a thread of continuity and identity.
* Eric Evans (Domain-Driven Design. Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software [53])
*
* An object must be distinguished from other objects even though they might have the same attributes.
* Mistaken identity can lead to data corruption.
* Eric Evans (Domain-Driven Design. Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software [54])
*
* An object defined primarily by its identity is called an ENTITY.
* Eric Evans (Domain-Driven Design. Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software [55])
*
* If one module depends upon another, that dependency should be physical, not just logical.
* Robert C. Martin (Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship)

Entity should have an identity. It's recommended to represent the entity identity as a Value Object what is
* consistent and easily validated.
* Using this approach, we are sure that all the id instances are valid.

## Aggregate Root
Martin Fowler (https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DDD_Aggregate.html)
>Aggregates are the basic element of transfer of data storage - you request to load or save whole aggregates. Transactions should not cross aggregate boundaries.

Evans DDD:
>An AGGREGATE is a cluster of associated objects that we treat as a unit for the purpose of data changes. Each AGGREGATE has a root and a boundary. The boundary defines what is inside the AGGREGATE. The root is a single, specific ENTITY contained in the AGGREGATE.

And:

>The root is the only member of the AGGREGATE that outside objects are allowed to hold references to[.]

In the context of the repository pattern, aggregate roots are the only objects your client code loads from the repository.

An example is a model containing a Customer entity and an Address entity. We would never access an Address entity directly from the model as it does not make sense without the context of an associated Customer. So we could say that Customer and Address together form an aggregate and that Customer is an aggregate root.

The repository encapsulates access to child objects - from a caller's perspective it automatically loads them, either at the same time the root is loaded or when they're actually needed (as with lazy loading).

For example, you might have an Order object which encapsulates operations on multiple LineItem objects. Your client code would never load the LineItem objects directly, just the Order that contains them, which would be the aggregate root for that part of your domain.


## Domain Event
Martin Fowler: (https://www.martinfowler.com/eaaDev/DomainEvent.html)
>Captures the memory of something interesting which affects the domain

## Domain Services
(https://aspnetboilerplate.com/Pages/Documents/Domain-Services)

Domain Services (or just Services in DDD) is used to perform domain operations and business rules. In his DDD book, Eric Evans describes a good Service in three characteristics:

- The operation relates to a domain concept that is not a natural part of an Entity or Value Object.
- The interface is defined in terms of other elements of the domain model.
- The operation is stateless.

# booking-domain
## booking-domain-core 
only creates and return the event. Domain service should not now about how to fire the event,
it's responsible for creating and returning the events after business logic complete

## booking-app-service
decides where and how run the events


## The differences between a domain service and an application services are subtle but critical:
(http://gorodinski.com/blog/2012/04/14/services-in-domain-driven-design-ddd/)

- Domain services are very granular where as application services are a facade purposed with providing an API.
- Domain services contain domain logic that canâ€™t naturally be placed in an entity or value object whereas application services orchestrate the execution of domain logic and donâ€™t themselves implement any domain logic.
- Domain service methods can have other domain elements as operands and return values whereas application services operate upon trivial operands such as identity values and primitive data structures.
- Application services declare dependencies on infrastructural services required to execute domain logic.
- Command handlers are a flavor of application services which focus on handling a single command typically in a CQRS architecture.
